        <p>Do you ever wonder how your origins affect the way you feel, think or even remember things? Our origins, whether social, environmental, genetic or cultural, shape our thoughts like an invisible hand. From the earliest memory to yesterday's chemistry lesson, each memory adds a layer to how we understand the world. But, in a world filled with mimicking and diverse experiences, it is essential to understand our past, lineage and culture, as it can shape and support us in more ways than one.</p>

        <p>One of the strongest ways our origins influence our way of learning is through culture. Culture acts like a lens through which we see and interpret the world around us. In other cultures, learning is something that is experienced together, where students work together and share ideas. In others, it's strictly independent and solitary. These cultures shape us not only how comfortable we feel with others but how we absorb information. Some students from certain cultures thrive through learning from discussion and collaboration, while some other students from a different culture prefer independent work and practice. What I'm trying to say is that analyzing your culture and other factors can help you not only study and remember information quicker but more effectively. Another key factor that influences our learning is language. It not only helps us communicate, but also shapes how we interpret the world around us.</p>

        <p>Language also plays a significant role in how we learn. The first language we learn to speak, builds the foundation of how we understand media today. Many bilingual people often have different perspectives as they understand more than one language. Additionally, some languages are more oral than others. This can affect how one can remember things. For example, many indigenous languages are based on storytelling. This causes people who understand that language to remember information more easily. On the other hand, languages like Italian are written more, so people from that language will remember reading things more. Moreover, some languages have extremely strict grammar rules, which can train your brain to approach math or logic problems with a different or unique perspective that differs from individuals from other languages. </p>

        <p>My first language was Arabic. Arabic is a very old language, more than 1445 years old. People who believe in Islam, read and study The Quran, which is read in Arabic. In fact, the Quran was first written in a type of Arabic called Quranic Arabic or Classical Arabic. Even though it is not a spoken language today, it is read by millions of people every day. Moreover, Arabic is a very dense or rich language. There is a word for almost anything. For  example, there is a word for a she-camel, and a she-camel with a child, and a she-camel who is pregnant, and a she-camel who is widowed. Because Arabic is so detailed, individuals who grew up with Arabic and are trying to learn English might have a hard time adjusting. In English, one word might be used for many meanings, while in Arabic, every small detail has its own word. This difference can even affect how someone structures an essay, or learns vocabulary. </p>

        <p>Your genetics also play a big role with how you learn. Even though we don't really think about it, the way our brain is built affects how we take in, process and understand information. Genetics is the development of specific traits, not just physically, but mentally as well. This means that certain genetics can run through your family. These conditions are called learning disorders. They can include ADHD and dyslexia. This doesn't mean you're not smart, just that your brain is wired differently. On the other hand, some students may develop strong skills like improving memory and logic or music and sports. Genetics can be seen as a starting point. It's up to you how you want to use it to help you. Just as our genes shape our minds from the inside, our environment shapes us from the outside</p>

        <p>The environment of where we grew up also affects our learning. Someone born in a big city with access to technology and education will learn differently than someone born in a rural village in Pakistan or Iran. We can imagine our mind like the environment we live in. Each environment is unique, with a different amount of sunlight, wind, rain and snow. All of this helps your brain to learn in different ways. In the fast-paced life of big cities, students may get used to background noises like cars honking and construction. Meanwhile, individuals from rural areas, where it's so quiet you can hear a pin drop, can be more sensitive to sound. This can affect how the two students take tests. For example, the city student might still focus well in a loud environment, while the student from the rural area might need a quiet space to concentrate.</p>

        <p id="end">Understanding our roots can help us understand how we live, think and understand text and media. Every language, culture and environment we are exposed to helps to shape the strengths and struggles in how we learn. By taking time to reflect on our "origin story", we gain a powerful tool to better connect with others and the power to grow in the right direction.</p>
